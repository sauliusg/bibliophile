Cumulative weed emergence in 1996 and 1997 was similar in cropped and noncropped areas. Herbicides were more effective than mechanical cultivation in reducing weed emergence 91%% in 1996 and 88%% in 1997. Weed emergence was similar in both rotary hoed area and cultivated area in 1996 but weed emergence was 44%% lower in rotary hoed plots than in cultivated plots in 1997. The Gompertz equation did not adequately predict weed seedling emergence in the untreated control and with in-row cultivation in 1996. Initial weed seedling emergence was observed at about 120 growing degree-days with 3 to 9%% cumulative emergence among treatments. In 1997, the Gompertz equation adequately described weed seedling emergence in plots with or without disturbed soil. Weed emergence was first observed at 80 growing degree-days with 6 to 16%% cumulative emergence among treatments. Predicted percent weed emergence closely approximated observed emergence in 1996 and 1997. Rotary hoeing plus in-row cultivation reduced maximum percent emergence rate 37%% on an average. The greater maximum percent emergence rate obtained with in-row cultivation suggests that this treatment increased weed seedling emergence in 1997. On average, weed seedling emergence in the untreated check was lower in cropped areas than in noncropped areas, implying a competitive effect by the dry bean crop. Although weed seedling emergence occurred throughout the growing season, more weed seedlings emerged in June and early July than in late July and August.Nomenclature: EPTC (S-ethyl dipropyl carbamothioate); ethalfluralin; redroot pigweed, Amaranthus retroflexus L.

        "abstractText": "Field research trials were conducted in Idaho at the Aberdeen Research and Extension Center in 2006 and 2007 to determine the critical interference period of hairy nightshade in potatoes. ‘Russet Norkotah' variety was planted both years in plots three rows wide by 12 m long. When the potatoes had emerged, one- to two-leaf hairy nightshade plants that had been germinated and grown in the greenhouse were transplanted at a 2 m⁻¹ row density and allowed to grow for 10, 20, 30, or 40 d after emergence (DAE) before removal, or the potatoes were maintained weed-free for 0, 10, 20, 30, or 40 DAE before transplanting. Potatoes were harvested from the center row at the end of each growing season and yield and grade was determined. Russet Norkotah is a small-canopied potato variety and often does not completely close canopy in Idaho. Russet Norkotah U.S. No. 1 and total tuber yield were similar to weed-free yield when hairy nightshade transplanting was delayed up to 22 or 24 DAE, respectively, or planted at emergence and allowed to remain for only 6 or 11 d, respectively. Otherwise, yield decrease was 5% or greater. Therefore, the critical weed-free period for Russet Norkotah potato U.S. No. 1 or total tuber yields was 6 to 22 or 11 to 24 DAE, respectively.Nomenclature: Hairy nightshade; Solanum physalifolium Rusby SOLSA; potato; Solanum tuberosum L. ‘Russet Norkotah'.",

Pyroxasulfone at 0.09 to 0.15 kg ai ha⁻¹ and saflufenacil at 0.05 to 0.07 kg ai ha⁻¹ applied PRE alone or in tank mixes with several currently labeled herbicides did not injure potatoes at either site in both years. KSU12800 at 0.15 kg ai ha⁻¹ injured potatoes from 18 to 26% for a period of about 4 wk after emergence at Ontario both years. In addition, KSU12800 at 0.29 and 0.45 kg ha⁻¹ injured potatoes from 17 to 38% at 17 d after treatment (DAT) at Paterson in 2009. Pyroxasulfone at 0.15 kg ha⁻¹ controlled barnyardgrass, hairy nightshade, and redroot pigweed 96% or greater, but control of common lambsquarters was variable. Saflufenacil at 0.07 kg ha⁻¹ provided greater than 93% control of common lambsquarters, hairy nightshade, and redroot pigweed at both sites in 2010. KSU12800 at 0.15 kg ha⁻¹ controlled common lambsquarters, hairy nightshade, and redroot pigweed 99% or more at Ontario, but only 87 to 93% at Paterson in 2010.

        "abstractText": "Hairy nightshade is the most widespread nightshade species in North America. Increased knowledge of hairy nightshade germination biology would facilitate development of an optimum control program. Germination of hairy nightshade seeds as affected by environmental and chemical factors was studied under greenhouse and controlled-environment growth chamber conditions. Hairy nightshade seeds were in an innate dormant state when initially separated from the berries. Moist compared with dry storage was more effective for breaking dormancy at 4 C, but dry storage was more effective at 17 C. Hairy nightshade seeds germinated equally well under both a 14-h photoperiod and continuous darkness. These germinated at constant temperatures ranging from 19 to 39 C, with optimum germination attained between 27 and 33 C. Germination markedly declined as osmotic potential of the germination medium decreased. The optimum pH range for germination of hairy nightshade seeds was between 6 and 8, although some seeds germinated at pH 4 and 9. Maximum hairy nightshade emergence occurred with seeding depths of 2 cm or less. No emergence occurred when seeding depth reached 8 cm.Nomenclature: Hairy nightshade, Solanum sarrachoides Sendtner SOLSA.",
