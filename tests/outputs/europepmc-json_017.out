When the potatoes had emerged, one- to two-leaf hairy nightshade plants that had been germinated and grown in the greenhouse were transplanted at a 2 m⁻¹ row density and allowed to grow for 10, 20, 30, or 40 d after emergence (DAE) before removal, or the potatoes were maintained weed-free for 0, 10, 20, 30, or 40 DAE before transplanting. Potatoes were harvested from the center row at the end of each growing season and yield and grade was determined. Russet Norkotah is a small-canopied potato variety and often does not completely close canopy in Idaho. Russet Norkotah U.S. No. 1 and total tuber yield were similar to weed-free yield when hairy nightshade transplanting was delayed up to 22 or 24 DAE, respectively, or planted at emergence and allowed to remain for only 6 or 11 d, respectively. Otherwise, yield decrease was 5% or greater. Therefore, the critical weed-free period for Russet Norkotah potato U.S. No. 1 or total tuber yields was 6 to 22 or 11 to 24 DAE, respectively.Nomenclature: Hairy nightshade; Solanum physalifolium Rusby SOLSA; potato; Solanum tuberosum L. ‘Russet Norkotah'.","language":"eng","pubModel":"Undetermined","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article"]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"https://doi.org/10.1614/WT-D-13-00160.1"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasReferences":"Y","hasTextMinedTerms":"N","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"Y","authMan":"N","epmcAuthMan":"N","nihAuthMan":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCompletion":"2015-11-27","dateOfCreation":"2015-11-27","dateOfRevision":"2015-12-18","firstPublicationDate":"2014-09-01"},{"id":"IND601311566","source":"AGR","doi":"10.1614/wt-d-12-00023.1","title":"Preemergence Herbicides for Potential Use in Potato Production","authorString":"Boydston RA, Felix J, Al-Khatib K.","authorList":{"author":[{"fullName":"Boydston RA","firstName":"Rick A","lastName":"Boydston","initials":"RA"},{"fullName":"Felix J","firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Felix","initials":"J"},{"fullName":"Al-Khatib K","firstName":"Kassim","lastName":"Al-Khatib","initials":"K"}]},"journalInfo":{"issue":"4","volume":"26","journalIssueId":2388778,"dateOfPublication":"2012 Nov","monthOfPublication":11,"yearOfPublication":2012,"printPublicationDate":"2012-11-01","journal":{"title":"Weed technology.","issn":"0890-037X","isoabbreviation":"Weed Technol","nlmid":"101308015"}},"pubYear":"2012","pageInfo":"731-739","abstractText":"Field trials were conducted in 2009 and 2010 near Paterson, WA and Ontario, OR to evaluate weed control and potato tolerance to PRE-applied pyroxasulfone, saflufenacil, and KSU12800 herbicides.

Increased knowledge of hairy nightshade germination biology would facilitate development of an optimum control program. Germination of hairy nightshade seeds as affected by environmental and chemical factors was studied under greenhouse and controlled-environment growth chamber conditions. Hairy nightshade seeds were in an innate dormant state when initially separated from the berries. Moist compared with dry storage was more effective for breaking dormancy at 4 C, but dry storage was more effective at 17 C. Hairy nightshade seeds germinated equally well under both a 14-h photoperiod and continuous darkness. These germinated at constant temperatures ranging from 19 to 39 C, with optimum germination attained between 27 and 33 C. Germination markedly declined as osmotic potential of the germination medium decreased. The optimum pH range for germination of hairy nightshade seeds was between 6 and 8, although some seeds germinated at pH 4 and 9. Maximum hairy nightshade emergence occurred with seeding depths of 2 cm or less. No emergence occurred when seeding depth reached 8 cm.Nomenclature: Hairy nightshade, Solanum sarrachoides Sendtner SOLSA.","language":"eng","pubModel":"Undetermined","pubTypeList":{"pubType":["Journal Article"]},"fullTextUrlList":{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":"Subscription required","availabilityCode":"S","documentStyle":"doi","site":"DOI","url":"https://doi.org/10.1614/WS-04-100R1"}]},"isOpenAccess":"N","inEPMC":"N","inPMC":"N","hasPDF":"N","hasBook":"N","citedByCount":0,"hasReferences":"N","hasTextMinedTerms":"N","hasDbCrossReferences":"N","hasLabsLinks":"N","authMan":"N","epmcAuthMan":"N","nihAuthMan":"N","hasTMAccessionNumbers":"N","dateOfCompletion":"2015-05-03","dateOfCreation":"2015-05-03","dateOfRevision":"2015-06-26","firstPublicationDate":"2005-01-01"},{"id":"IND601309237","source":"AGR","title":"Effect of in-row cultivation, herbicides, and dry bean canopy on weed seedling emergence","authorString":"Amador-Ramirez MD, Wilson RG, Martin AR.","authorList":{"author":[{"fullName":"Amador-Ramirez MD","firstName":"Mario D","lastName":"Amador-Ramirez","initials":"MD"},{"fullName":"Wilson RG","firstName":"Robert G","lastName":"Wilson","initials":"RG"},{"fullName":"Martin AR","firstName":"Alex R","lastName":"Martin","initials":"AR"}]},"journalInfo":{"issue":"3","volume":"50","journalIssueId":2388148,"dateOfPublication":"2002 May","monthOfPublication":5,"yearOfPublication":2002,"printPublicationDate":"2002-05-01","journal":{"title":"Weed science.","issn":"0043-1745","isoabbreviation":"Weed Sci.","nlmid":"9879514"}},"pubYear":"2002","pageInfo":"370-377","abstractText":"Field experiments were conducted in 1996 and 1997 to evaluate the effect of EPTC (S-ethyl dipropyl carbamothioate) plus ethalfluralin at 2.4 plus 0.83 kg ai ha⁻⁻¹, rotary hoeing, in-row cultivation, rotary hoeing plus in-row cultivation, and dry bean canopy on weed seedling emergence. Cumulative weed emergence in 1996 and 1997 was similar in cropped and noncropped areas. Herbicides were more effective than mechanical cultivation in reducing weed emergence 91%% in 1996 and 88%% in 1997. Weed emergence was similar in both rotary hoed area and cultivated area in 1996 but weed emergence was 44%% lower in rotary hoed plots than in cultivated plots in 1997. The Gompertz equation did not adequately predict weed seedling emergence in the untreated control and with in-row cultivation in 1996. Initial weed seedling emergence was observed at about 120 growing degree-days with 3 to 9%% cumulative emergence among treatments. In 1997, the Gompertz equation adequately described weed seedling emergence in plots with or without disturbed soil. Weed emergence was first observed at 80 growing degree-days with 6 to 16%% cumulative emergence among treatments. Predicted percent weed emergence closely approximated observed emergence in 1996 and 1997. Rotary hoeing plus in-row cultivation reduced maximum percent emergence rate 37%% on an average. The greater maximum percent emergence rate obtained with in-row cultivation suggests that this treatment increased weed seedling emergence in 1997. On average, weed seedling emergence in the untreated check was lower in cropped areas than in noncropped areas, implying a competitive effect by the dry bean crop. Although weed seedling emergence occurred throughout the growing season, more weed seedlings emerged in June and early July than in late July and August.Nomenclature: EPTC (S-ethyl dipropyl carbamothioate); ethalfluralin; redroot pigweed, Amaranthus retroflexus L.
